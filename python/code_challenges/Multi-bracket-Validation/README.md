## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I use the stack and its method (push, pop and is_empty)

comlexity is : O(1)
## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->

it will check if every bracket has it own close bracket it will return True else it will return False
ex :
`validate_brackets("{()()}")` 
  - the output will be `True`

- [x] test the validation bracket and return true
- [x] check if the stack is empty
- [x] return False if the validation bracket is failed
