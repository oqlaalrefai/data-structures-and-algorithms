# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

## Approach & Efficiency
I used class and loops to create methods related to linkedList data structure

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
* Node
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.\
* Linked List
include a head property this class to link all nodes together
  - class methods :
    - insert : Adds a new node with that value to the head
    - includes : Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
    - to string : Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
