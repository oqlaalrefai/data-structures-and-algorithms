# Stacks and Queues
create stack and queue data strucrure 

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
create method related to each data structure

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
iteration approach that take a complexity 
- O(n) for specific method or O(1) for almost method

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->
queue method :
  - enqueue
  - dequeue
  - is_empty
  - peek
stack method :
  - push
  - pop
  - peek
  - is_empty


- [x] Can successfully push onto a stack
- [x] Can successfully push multiple values onto a stack
- [x] Can successfully pop off the stack
- [x] Can successfully empty a stack after multiple pops
- [x] Can successfully peek the next item on the stack
- [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty stack
- [x] Calling pop or peek on empty stack raises exception
- [x] Can successfully enqueue into a queue
- [x] Can successfully enqueue multiple values into a queue
- [x] Can successfully dequeue out of a queue the expected value
- [x] Can successfully peek into a queue, seeing the expected value
- [x] Can successfully empty a queue after multiple dequeues
- [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty queue
- [x] Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception
