## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I use two queues to implement the animal shelter
  - enqueue 
  - dequeue 
**Efficiency:**
basic command
Time: O(1) Space: O(1)
## Solution
enqueue('cat') :
input :
cat->cat->

output :
cat->cat->cat

dequeue('dog') :
input :

dog->dog->dog
output :

dog->dog-
