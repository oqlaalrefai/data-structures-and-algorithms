# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
I create a function called left join which has two argument two hash maps first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values. and The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Iterate through the entire 1st hash table (the left table) and when an element is found, check if that element's key exists in the second hash table. If it does, append (key, value_1, value_2) if it does not append (key, value_1, None).
