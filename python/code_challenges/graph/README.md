# Graphs
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Graphs are complex, non-linear data structures that are characterized by a group of vertices, connected by edges.
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

1. add node
2. add edge
3. get nodes
4. get neighbors
5. size

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
complexity is :
Time :
space :

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in your Graph -->
1. add node :
to add node or vertices to the graph
2. add edge :
to Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
3. get nodes :
Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection 
4. get neighbors :
Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection
5. size :
to Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
